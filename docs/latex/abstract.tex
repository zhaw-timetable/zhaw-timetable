\noindent Where is my next lecture? Is there a free room for me to study in? What is the Lunch Menu today?

\noindent These are just a few of the many questions Students have to deal with daily and getting an anwser to these questions isn't always that easy.

\noindent Our vision for zhawo is to build a modern application that helps the students of the ZHAW with their every day study needs. Using agile development, the goal is to work closely with students to provide an application that is tailored to their specific needs.

\noindent We want to provide our Users a fast, reliable and engaging experience across all Platforms. That is why we have chosen to develop zhawo as a Progressive Web App. Progressive Web Apps are web apps that behave like native apps. That means the application can be accessed by any device that has a browser, whilst still providing the user with the look and feel of a native app.
