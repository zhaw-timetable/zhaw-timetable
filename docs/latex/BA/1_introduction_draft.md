### Introduction Text

- Explain need for roomsearch and issues with inconsistent applications across Android and iOS
- Explain concept of PWA for cross-platform apps, one code base
- Explain goal of providing students with a feature-rich application as well as assessing development of a PWA

We established a prototype for ZHAWo, a Progressive Web Application (PWA) for students of the Zurich University of Applied Sciences (ZHAW) in a previous project. The goal of this project is to transform the prototype to a production-ready application that can be distributed to and used by the students. The focus in this work is put on development of a feature-rich, production-ready PWA while evaluating advantages and disadvantages of using Progressive Web App technologies as well as user reception of our application.
