\noindent Where is my next lecture? Is there a free room for me to study in? What is the Lunch Menu today?

\noindent These are just a few of the many questions Students have to deal with daily and getting an anwser to these questions isn't always that easy.

\noindent Our vision for zhawo is to solve this. All the information regarding your life a the ZHAW in one place.

\noindent We want to provide our Users a fast, Reliable and Engaging experience across all Platforms. That is why we have chosen to develop zhawo as a Progressive Web App. Progressive Web Apps are web apps that behave like native apps. That means the application can be accessed by any device that has a browser, whilst still gives the user the look and feel of a native app.
