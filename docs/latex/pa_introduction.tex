# Introduction

Students of the Zürcher Hochschule für Angewandte Wissenschaften (ZHAW) have different applications and sites to get
information about their schedules and menu plans of their mensa.
%TODO change this sentence below -> less complicated

However, apart from the official Android application \cite{DUMMY},
they are either not well suited for use on mobile devices in the case of the official schedule site \cite{DUMMY} or feel
outdated.

By using progressive web application (PWA) technologies \cite{DUMMY} --> a platform independent application...

Our vision for zhawo is to build a modern Progressive Web App that helps the students of the ZHAW with their every day study needs. Using agile development, the goal is to work closely with students to provide an application that is tailored to their specific needs.
A few features that we are planning to implement:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Timetable}: students often need to quickly check what courses they have next and where they need to go. The availability of this feature is very important and has been noted as being an issue with the "official" timetable app. Using intelligent caching and a modern user interface, we aim to improve this aspect.
  \item \textbf{Room search}: when we first started there was an application, that allowed students to search for free rooms all over their campus. This was very useful as study programmes at the ZHAW put a huge focus on group projects, but with limited quiet public working spaces, finding a free room was often vital. The app that only ever existed for Android devices has since completely disappeared.
  \item \textbf{Menu plans}: There are menu plans on the official provider of the mensa food's website. However, this site is rather unknown and we plan to include an easy way to check today's and upcoming menus and prices.
  \item \textbf{Student events}: We plan to work with vszhaw to bring more attention to student parties and events, by integrating their event feed into zhawo.
\end{itemize}
