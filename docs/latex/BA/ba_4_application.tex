\section{Application} \label{application}

The user interface was designed to provide students with the familiar look and feel of a native mobile application. We chose a minimalistic design approach. The focus was on displaying relevant information without any distracting noise or clutter and a fast and intuitive user experience. Users can choose between a light theme and a dark theme (Figures \ref{fig:LoginFigure}, \ref{fig:MenuFigure} and \ref{fig:EventsFigure}).
On desktop devices the drawer is always open and contains the navigation (Figures \ref{fig:DesktopSchedule} and \ref{fig:DesktopRoomsearch}).

A detailed interaction flow with ZHAWo is described in the following sections.

## General

On a users first visit to ZHAWo, a prompt is shown to enter their ZHAW username (Figure \ref{fig:LoginFigure} A). A list of all available student and professor names is loaded and on user input, suggestions from that list are displayed. Since there is no persistent user specific data, setting up an account is not needed. The ZHAW username is required to fetch the correct timetable. This username is stored and on the next visit, the initial screen is skipped and users have immediate access to their timetable.

Through a collapsible application drawer, users have access to some basic settings like switching between display modes of the timetable and changing the application theme (Figure \ref{fig:LoginFigure} B). The two timetable display modes show the user's timetable for either a single day or a full week. The saved ZHAW username can be cleared by clicking the logout button at the bottom of the application drawer.

Switching between contexts (corresponding to the four primary functions timetable, mensa menus, room search and student events) is done through labeled icons on a navigation bar at the bottom of the screen (Figure \ref{fig:LoginFigure} C). The application state such as selected date or time frame for the room search are preserved between context switches.

## Timetable

By default, the timetable is displayed in a day view (Figure \ref{fig:TimetableFigure1} A). Individual events are displayed in their corresponding time slots. The time slots are displayed on the left with a subtle indicator for the current time slot. If there are events that overlap in time, they are displayed next to each other in the day view. To navigate between different dates, users can swipe to the right to advance one day or swipe to the left to go to the previous day respectively. Above the timetable, a navigation bar is displayed which highlights the currently displayed day or week. As an alternative to the swipe interactions, users can directly select a date in the navigation bar or jump one week back or forward by clicking on the arrow buttons. To quickly jump back to the timetable of day current day or week, users can click on the calendar icon in a context action area on the top right of the screen (Figure \ref{fig:TimetableFigure1} B).

In addition to the day view, users can choose to display their timetable for a whole week. Since display space is limited especially on small mobile devices, overlapping events are shown as an indicator below the longest running event during that time frame as seen in Figure \ref{fig:TimetableFigure1} B.

When clicking on a specific event, a modal pops up displaying detailed information about that event (Figure \ref{fig:TimetableFigure1} C).

Users can also search for and display other timetables than their own. Clicking on the search icon button in the context action area opens a modal. Users can search for and display timetables of other students, lecturers, classes, courses or rooms (Figure \ref{fig:TimetableFigure2} A and B). The currently displayed search timetable can be cleared by clicking the indicator in the context action area (Figure \ref{fig:TimetableFigure2} C).

## Mensa menus

The mensa menus are displayed as a list of available menus with their category, menu name and description and ZHAW internal prices. The title indicates the mensa where the currently displayed menu is offered. By clicking the mensa icon in the context action area, users can switch between different mensas (Figure \ref{fig:MenuFigure} A and B). Navigation between menus of different days is consistent with the navigation for the timetable context, with a navigation bar in addition to swipe gestures.

## Room search

To search for currently unoccupied rooms at the ZHAW School of Engineering Technikum campus, users can enter a time range during which they want to use the room (Figure \ref{fig:RoomSearchFigure} A). Once they've entered the start and end time, they can press the search button and the rooms will be filtered to only show rooms that are unoccupied during the chosen time slots. To browse the free rooms, the users can navigate through a map of the  campus showing all the buildings. Buildings highlighted in blue have at least one free room during the entered time range (Figure \ref{fig:RoomSearchFigure} B). To see which rooms are free, users can click on a building on the map, and a floor plan of that building will appear with labeled and highlighted free rooms. They can navigate through the different floors with the buttons above the floor plans. The individual floor plans show which rooms are free and where they are (Figure \ref{fig:RoomSearchFigure} C). To switch to a different building, users can navigate back to the campus overview map through the School Of Engineering button next to the floor navigation.

## Student events

Users can browse vszhaw news as a chronological list of blog posts. The full news posts are linked and can be reached by clicking on the individual posts. If there is an upcoming event in the official vszhaw calendar, it will be featured above the news feed (Figure \ref{fig:EventsFigure} A and B). Additionally, student events are displayed as a banner in the timetable context of their date (Figure \ref{fig:EventsFigure} C). Both the banner and student event feature are linked to more a detailed view of the event on the vszhaw website.
