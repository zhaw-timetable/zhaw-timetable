## About

With [**ZHAWo**](https://zhawo.ml) we provide students of the ZHAW a modern progressive web app to help with their every day study needs. Using agile development, the goal was to work closely with students to provide an application that is tailored to their specific needs.

The main features of ZHAWo are:

- Timetable: students often need to quickly check what courses they have next and where they need to go. The availability of this feature is very important and has been noted as being an issue with the "official" timetable app. Using intelligent caching and a modern user interface, we aim to improve this aspect.

- Room search: when we first started there was an application, that allowed students to search for free rooms all over their campus. This was very useful as study programmes at the ZHAW put a huge focus on group projects, but with limited quiet public working spaces, finding a free room was often vital. The app that only ever existed for Android devices has since completely disappeared.

- Menu plans: There are menu plans on the official provider of the mensa food's website. However, this site is rather unknown and we plan to include an easy way to check today's and upcoming menus and prices.

- Student events: We want to bring more attention to student parties and events, by integrating their news feed and their events into zhawo.
