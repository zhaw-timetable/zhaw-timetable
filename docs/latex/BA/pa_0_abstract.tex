\noindent We also integrated news and events from the Verein Studierende ZHAW (vszhaw) into ZHAWo to provide students with easier access to information about events and services.

\noindent Using the JavaScript frameworks React for the frontend and Express for the backend in combination with Progressive Web App enables us to apply an agile development approach with fast prototyping of new features while still providing an application with the functionalities and feel that users expect from a native app. With this approach, we also avoid having to maintain multiple code bases for different platforms and mixing different technologies for frontend and backend. As a consequence, extending and improving the application's functionality can be done at a high velocity.
